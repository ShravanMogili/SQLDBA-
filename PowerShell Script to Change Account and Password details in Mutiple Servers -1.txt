Change the following variables to your need:
$ServiceAccount = The new Service Account
$ServicePassword = The new Service Account Password
$Srvs = List of the Services which should be changed
Also create a server.txt file located in the same location where the scirpt is located. Insert a list of servers, one server name per row.
The Script will prompt you for administrative credentials which will be used to change the configured services.
