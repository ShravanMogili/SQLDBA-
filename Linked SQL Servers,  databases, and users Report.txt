Linked SQL Servers,  databases, and users Report


Fixed user protion of the script. Sorry had the test script mixed with prod. I was asked to create a report listing all of our SQL Servers, and the databases on them. I was also asked to list everyone that has access to each database and whether it was a standard, windows or windows group login.
I run this against a server that has all the servers linked. The script uses embeded cursors. This is my first script that I am sharing. I did not see any scripts out that provide the same information. I am sure that there can be improvements and I would like to see any.
