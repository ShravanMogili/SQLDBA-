--Restore--Restore DB Audit--What got restored from where, by who and when
--https://www.sqlservercentral.com/scripts/what-got-restored-from-where-by-who-and-when

--Working in a small environment where people have their fingers in many pies can sometimes be a pain.
--The developers have full db_owner rights to the databases and can restore the DB to a previous version, 
--this script helped my find who restored what, when they restored it and what backup / server was used as the source database.
--Not that I like pointing fingers at who broke something, but could come in handy 
--if someone rolled back the DB and something went missing.
