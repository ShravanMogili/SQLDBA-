--LOG FILE GROWTH – FREE SPACE ALERT
Our goal will be accomplished in only two steps,

Creating a user defined stored procedure in your user database then,
Creating a job with a Schedule to run that stored procedure how frequently you want to check the log space (you-decide).
Below is the script to create stored procedure that sends out an e-mail alert when log fills out to certain value (it depends on your requirement). In my case if my log file is of total 60GB then I set the benchmark to 50 GB so that I can have some time to do some tactics to figure it out what transactions are making it to fill or some other reasons and take some precautions to avoid it. Benchmark is nothing but when you want to get an alert once log reaches to that value or size.

Here is the script that helped me; hopefully it helps you I guess.
