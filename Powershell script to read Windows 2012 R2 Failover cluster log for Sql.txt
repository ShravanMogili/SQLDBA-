Powershell script to read Windows 2012 R2 Failover cluster log for Sql

 I was having a hard time to reading the Windows 2012 R2 Failover cluster log from my live server. 

That is why I just wrote a simple PowerShell script to get the job done for me.  By using id = 1641 I can get the information when my failover occurred.

Open the PowerShell console and type the scripts, put your own server name in the place of “ServerName”. 




Get-winEvent -ComputerName ServerName -filterHashTable @{logname = 'Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering/Operational'; id=1641}
