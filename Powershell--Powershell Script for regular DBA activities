Most of the time, the developers come to the DBA for some routine tasks like Sql Backups and restore for different development
and testing environments. This requires DBA to manually perform these operations via SSMS. Sometimes the operation is straight forward, 
while most of the times we have to configure some advanced options for our operations.

This small powershell utility takes care of such operations and elegantly performs it via command shell without SSMS interaction.

Such utilities can be easily used by the developers in the team without making them approach to DBA for such tasks on various development 
or testing environments.

Please note, this tool supports below operations on the same Sql Server machine : 

1.      Backup a DB to a physical .bak file

2.      Restore a DB from a .bak file

3.      Restore a DB from a DB

4.      Create a new DB from existing DB

Below is the working of this utility explained:
