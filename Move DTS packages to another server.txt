 the easiest way to transfer DTS packages is with bcp, not only works with 2000 but also will move to 2005 as well.



on production 

EXEC master.dbo.xp_cmdshell "bcp msdb.dbo.sysdtspackages out f:\DRTEST\DTS_Packages.txt -c"

on DR

EXEC master.dbo.xp_cmdshell "bcp msdb.dbo.sysdtspackages in f:\DRTest\DTS_Packages.txt -c -E -T"
